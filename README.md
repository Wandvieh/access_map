The map can be interacted with [here](https://wandvieh.github.io/access_map/).

The Access Map is a tool that visualizes a handicapped person's perspective by wiping out all the stations that are not accessible. This is a redeployment of Arduina's project from Berlin. The map was originally created by the <a href="http://mappable.info">Mappable</a> initiative from Hamburg.

<h4>Where can I get more information?</h4>

You can find more information and the inspiration for this project on <a href="http://arduina.github.io/access_map/">Berlin's version</a> of this map (rather, this map is a version of the Berlin map). Find a How To there too, for making this yourself! The text above is also taken from that repository.

The map of Trier's stations is downloaded from the <a href="https://www.vrt-info.de/service/downloads">official website</a>. The project is from 2023.
